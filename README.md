# -GBG_Spring2022

Hey everyone this is the official repository for our spring 2022 GBG project. This project is aimed to help create a solution to help a toddler achieve a higher degree 
of autonomous movement than currently available. The recipient is affected by severe axonal motor neuropathy, as a result movement below her neck is not possible. After
consideration we hae decided that we will utilze an arduino control unit to take input from head movement (registered by an MPU6050 sensor) and control a
L298N motor control module to control direction and movement of the modified stroller. Our hope is that by putting this code out here, we can not only keep a formal 
record of our developed software, but can also share it for others to utilize if needed or build upon it for more efficient and accesible systems and solutions. 

Our work is non profit and we do not require permission asking to use our files or modify them,
treat this repository as an open source please. If you do happen to take code from contributions made with a specific author name in them, just please make sure to 
give appropiate credit. If our project inspired you or has led your team to build upon it for a new project we'd love to keep in touch so we can know how to make our
solutions more effective in the future, and/or to help you develop your projects. Our contact is uhbmes@central.uh.edu or uh.bmes@gmail.com
